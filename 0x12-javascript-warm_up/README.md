JavaScript is amazing because of its versatility, easy learning curve, flexibility, and large community support.
To run a JavaScript script, you can use a browser or Node.js.
Variables are created using let or var, and constants with const.
Differences: var has function scope, let has block scope and allows re-assignment, and const is for constant values.
JavaScript has primitive types (number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol) and objects.
if and if...else statements are used for conditional execution.
Comments are written using // for single-line and /* ... */ for multi-line.
Values are assigned to variables using the assignment operator (=).
Loops: while for repeated execution based on a condition, and for for executing a block of code for a specific number of iterations.
break and continue are used to control loop execution.
A function is a reusable block of code. Functions can have a return statement to send a value back.
Variables have different scopes: global, function, or block scope.
Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, ++, --) are used for mathematical operations.
Objects can be used as dictionaries for key-value storage.
JavaScript does not have a built-in file import mechanism. However, in certain environments (e.g., Node.js), you can use the require or import statements to import external files.
